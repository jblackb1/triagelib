# How to contribute
This project is not yet totally complete and there are still many things that need done. I definitely welcome any additions and advice for fleshing this out.

I know this guide is not very specific. I will make additions if necessary but this is my first GitHub project and I am learning. :)

# Submitting changes
Please follow the coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Please send a GitHub Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done.

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
